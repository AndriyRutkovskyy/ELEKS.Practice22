1. Using Spark, load contents of /user/cloudera/certification/input/retail_db/customers/. 
Find only those customers who live in CA state and save 
the subset to /user/cloudera/certification/uno/task3/california as avro with snappy compression.

var customers = sc.textFile("/user/cloudera/spark/retail_db/customers")

var customersDf = customers.map(rec => {
    var row = rec.split(',')
    (row(0).toInt, row(1) + " " + row(2), row(7))
}).toDF("customer_id", "customer_name", "customer_state")

res = customersDf.filter(customersDf("customer_state") === "CA")

res.saveAsTextFile("/user/cloudera/spark/output/task_01_out")
